#MultiLevelIPF

Implementation of algorithms that extend IPF to nested structures.

The IPF algorithm operates on count data.  This package offers implementations for several algorithms that extend this to nested structures: "parent" and "child" items for both of which constraints can be provided.

Install using

    devtools::install_github("krlmlr/MultiLevelIPF")

(requires `devtools` 1.4 or later) or

    devtools::install_github("MultiLevelIPF", "krlmlr")

My [`kimisc` package](/krlmlr/kimisc) is also required.
